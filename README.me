📸 InstaGuest

InstaGuest is a simple, robust, and modern desktop application to download Instagram posts (Images, Videos, Captions) from public profiles without requiring a login.

Built with Python, CustomTkinter, and Instaloader.

🚀 Features

Guest Mode: No Instagram account or login required. Safe from bans.

Media Download: Downloads high-quality images and videos.

Get URLs Only: Option to extract only post links (very fast) without downloading files.

Smart Skipping: Automatically skips posts that have already been downloaded.

Modern UI: Clean and dark-themed user interface using CustomTkinter.

⚠️ Limitations

Quantity Limit: Due to Instagram's strict restrictions for guest users, the app can usually fetch only the first 12 to 24 posts of a profile.

Public Profiles Only: Can only access public accounts.
